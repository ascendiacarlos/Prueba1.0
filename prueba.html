		<h3>About:</h3>
		<p>I currently am working as a UX Engineer at GoDaddy, which is where my passion for design<br> and development converge. See my previous work history on LinkedIn. Outside of work I have a beautiful<br> wife and cat (obviously). Currently I am not accepting freelance work, but I'd love to get coffee and get<br> to know you, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.</p>

		<h4>UI/UX Design</h4>

		UI/UX involves planning and iterating a site's structure and layout. Once the proper information<br> architecture is in place, I design the visual layer to create a beautiful user experience.

		<h4>Front End Development</h4>

		Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website. Using HTML, CSS , and<br> Javascript, I build fast, interactive websites. This also may include integrating a CMS.

		<h4>Brand Y Collateral Design</h4>

		While most of my attention is on interactive projects, I do branding and collateral from time to time.<br> This includes logo design, business cards, and other printed materials.</p>
